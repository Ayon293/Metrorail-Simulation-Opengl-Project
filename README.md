# Metrorail-Simulation-Opengl-Project
This project is a simple metro rail simulation using OpenGL and C++. It shows a metro train moving through a city with buildings, roads, stations, platforms, and passengers. The aim is to practice computer graphics techniques and gain hands-on 2D/3D OpenGL programming experience.

 ## Features:

- Metro Rail station environment  
- Passenger characters moving inside the station  
- Train arriving at the platform  
- Day and Night mode for the 3rd scenario  
- User controls via keyboard & mouse  
- Background music to make the simulation realistic  
- Simple low-poly style graphics
