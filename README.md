# Metrorail-Simulation-Opengl-Project
This project is a simple metro rail simulation using OpenGL and C++. It shows a metro train moving through a city with buildings, roads, stations, platforms, and passengers. The aim is to practice computer graphics techniques and gain hands-on 2D/3D OpenGL programming experience.
